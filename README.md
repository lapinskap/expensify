## General info
Complex React App based on Andrew Mead tutorials. Main functionality is to store expenses and count them.
Thanks to this project I met the React Router and Redux.
In this example I got to know the concept of application testing and the first time I turned react app on the production mode.

I started learning React Router to create an application that will have several subpages, in contrast to “ToDo” app. Afterwards I started to get acquainted with Redux. It took me a long time because I had to understand why we need it. It’s about sending props and state between components.
